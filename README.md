# BioHarmony
A place to centrally document our combined knowledge towards a BioHarmonic way of life.

Everything is connected, so organizing information can be hard. We attempt to organize our knowledge heirarchically, with large abstract pillars that are further refined and cross-referenced as you dig deeper. Soon, there will be a graphical interface to explore these topics.
