# Inner Truths
These pillars operate the level of the individual. They are the ideas that must be understood and agreed on by all, in order for us to act as a common force for the change we wish to see.

## Eco-Centrism
We must start with shifting our value system to put the wholistic health of the environment first, rather than the typical human-centric value system that prioritizes human progress, comfort, and growth. Only when we see ourselves as humble stewards of this beautiful world, will we be able to live in true harmony with it. 

## Ecological Philosophy

## Ecological Theology
No matter your view of the divine, the earth and our natural world is undoubtedly connected to us on a level above our physical understanding.

## Art and Culture
The beauty of our environment flows naturally into our artistic expression. Whenhumans embrace their bio-region, it will undoubtedly mold their culture. Life is more beautiful when we embrace and celebrate this connectedness.
